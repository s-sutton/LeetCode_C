Translating basic programming concepts between different languages
<h1>The Principles</h1>
*Writing and calling variables

*Writing and calling functions (conditionals, loops, structures)

*Writing and calling scripts

*Input sanitization

*Tree, array, and heap manipulation

*Linked lists

*Basic sorting algorithms (such as bubble sort)

*Different outputs, depending on language (such as draw or print or blinking an LED)

*Language specific libraries and style guides

*Making a short text adventure that takes advantage of various forms of output and libraries, with input sanitization

"[An Entire Computer Science Degree in 12 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJiVWoFk8GA)" by [Jason Goodison](https://www.youtube.com/@JasonGoodison). It has a very bare resemblance to what I'm explaining here.
