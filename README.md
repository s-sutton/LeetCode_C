Translating basic programming concepts between different languages

<h2>The Principles</h2>

* Writing and calling variables
* Writing and calling functions (conditionals, loops, structures)
* Writing and calling scripts
* Input sanitization
* Tree, array, and heap manipulation
* Linked lists
* Basic sorting algorithms (such as bubble sort)
* Different outputs, depending on language (such as draw or print or blinking an LED)
* Language specific libraries and style guides
* Making a short text adventure that takes advantage of various forms of output and libraries, with input sanitization

<h2>The video that inspired this approach:</h2>

"[An Entire Computer Science Degree in 12 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJiVWoFk8GA)" by [Jason Goodison](https://www.youtube.com/@JasonGoodison). It has a very bare resemblance to what I'm explaining here.

<h2>Simple Programs to Code</h2>

In each programming language, apply the necessary principles to create a command-line utility that can perform a variety of calculations.

*Interface to choose what kind of calculation
*An addition and subtraction calculation with two user-defined numbers
*An addition and subtraction calculation with an arbitrary quantity of user-defined numbers
*A multiplication and division calculation with two user-defined numbers
*Converting lengthy calculations using PEMDAS to perform an arbitrary quantity of calculations
*More complex mathematics such as logarithms, cosine, and sine functions
*An ASCII grid display for graphing functions (assuming a monospace font)
*Sorting an arbitrary quantity of numbers from both least to greatest and greatest to least
*From a sorted list of numbers, determine median, mean, and range
*Maybe rudimentary 3D animation, such as a spinning torus or a cube, also rendered in ASCII

The idea here is to, essentially, figure out the basic building blocks of these languages so that it is easier to transition to building more complex programs.
