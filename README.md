Translating basic programming concepts between different languages
<h1>The Principles</h1>
  <ul class="a">
    <li>Writing and calling variables</li>

    <li>Writing and calling functions (conditionals, loops, structures)</li>

    <li>Writing and calling scripts</li>

    <li>Input sanitization</li>

    <li>Tree, array, and heap manipulation</li>

    <li>Linked lists</li>

    <li>Basic sorting algorithms (such as bubble sort)</li>

    <li>Different outputs, depending on language (such as draw or print or blinking an LED)</li>

    <li>Language specific libraries and style guides</li>

    <li>Making a short text adventure that takes advantage of various forms of output and libraries, with input sanitization</li>
  </ul>

"[An Entire Computer Science Degree in 12 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJiVWoFk8GA)" by [Jason Goodison](https://www.youtube.com/@JasonGoodison). It has a very bare resemblance to what I'm explaining here.
