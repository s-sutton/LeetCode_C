<h1>coding-principles</h1>

Translating basic programming concepts between different languages

<h2>The Principles</h2>

* Writing and calling variables
* Writing and calling functions (conditionals, loops, structures)
* Writing and calling scripts
* Input sanitization
* Tree, array, and heap manipulation
* Linked lists
* Basic sorting algorithms (such as bubble sort)
* Different outputs, depending on language (such as draw or print or blinking an LED)
* Language specific libraries and style guides
* Making a short text adventure that takes advantage of various forms of output and libraries, with input sanitization

"[An Entire Computer Science Degree in 12 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJiVWoFk8GA)" by [Jason Goodison](https://www.youtube.com/@JasonGoodison). It has a very bare resemblance to what I'm explaining here.
