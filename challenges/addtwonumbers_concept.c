/* Pseudocode

-Define the carryTheOne variable, set it to 0
-Loop through the two lists, starting at the end
-Add each corresponding element together with the carryTheOne variable
-Check if the solution is higher than 10, if not then store the solution in the output list and set carryTheOne to 0
-If the solution is higher than 10, assign 1 to the carryTheOne variable, then subtract 10 before storing the solution in the output list
-Return the output list
