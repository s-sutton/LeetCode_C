<h2>Steps</h2>

1. List available calculation modes (start with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
2. Query user input to select calculation (with input validation)
3. Jump to corresponding subroutine
4. For each subroutine, prompt user input for first number
5. Then prompt user input for second number
6. Then display the result

<h2>Further considerations</h2>

Once the above works, move on to interpreting single-string inputs such as "1+2" or "2*4"
